# BUD-10

## Blob Search

`draft` `optional`

This BUD defines a new endpoint that let users to query blobs based on their metadata or meaning.

### GET /search - searching for a blob

#### Request

This request can contain the following query params:

1. Any fields defined in [BUD-02](./02.md) and [BUD-08](./08.md): `https://example.com/search?<field_name_as_per_08_or_02>=<value>`. This will check for an exact match. For values like timestamp or size that may need to be queried by range, value can be a strict value or a 2 index array that represents the range.

2. `search`: `https://example.com/search?search="Happy pigs on a farm"`. This can be queried on blob description or based on blob content semantically.

3. `limit`: number of results to return.

4. `offset`: number of items to skip (for offset-based model)

5. `cursor`: opaque pagination token (for cursor-based model)

Expect `offset` and `cursor`, other params can be used together to make more complex queries.

#### Response

Response example:

```jsonc
{
  "results": ["0x123456789abcdef", /* Blob sha256's that can be queried for actual blob or description only... */],
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 40,            // for offset-based
  "next_cursor": "...",    // for cursor-based
  "total": 1234            // optional
}
```
